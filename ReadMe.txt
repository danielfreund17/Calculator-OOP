1) The program calculates an expression.
2) The program validates the input.
3) make sure you don't use the sign '=' at the end of the expression.
4) The program was structured and built in a reusable way, means that if you wish to add new operations (let's say like Modulo( '%')), all you need to do is to create a new class,
    that inherits Operation class, update CalcExpressionClass's ctor, and update it in OperationCreator class. (add a define, and update the CreateOperation func).
5) The program calculates also expression with parentheses.
5) I was developing on Visual Studio Proffesional 2015.
6) I added a simple UML diagram as JPG.
7) I also added folder with running samples.
8) Made by Daniel Freund.
